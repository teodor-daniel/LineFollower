# LineFollower

## Project Description üåü

The objective of this project is to construct a line-following robot, utilizing a reflectance sensor to determine the line position. Two motors, managed by an L293D motor driver, are used to guide the robot along the line, aiming to maintain its central position. An Arduino UNO serves as the main controller, responsible for reading sensor data, computing the required motor speeds using a PID controller, and adjusting the motors accordingly. To address the power limitations of the Arduino, an additional 7.4V Li-Po battery is incorporated to power the motors.

## Project Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

- Arduino UNO (Main controller)
- QTR-8A Reflectance Sensor (Line detection)
- L293D Motor Driver (Motor control)
- 7.4V Li-Po Battery (Motor power supply)
- DC Motors (Movement)
- Chassis (Constructed from foam board)
- Ball Caster (Enhances stability)
- LEDs (Headlights, backlights, and underglow)
- Joystick for movement and shooting
- Buzzer for audio feedback
- LCD display for game stats and menu
- Necessary wiring

## Project Design üåà

Our team of three had to creatively engineer the robot from scratch, beginning with the construction of the chassis. Instead of a pre-made base, we were provided with a simple piece of foam board, challenging us to design and shape our own chassis.

We securely mounted the motors to the chassis and connected to the L293D motor driver to independently power each wheel. To supply the necessary energy to the motors, we mounted the battery under the chassis to give it a lower center of gravity.

We incorporated the ball caster into the design, enhancing stability and offering crucial support, thereby facilitating smooth maneuvering, especially when negotiating curves or making corrections to its course. In our attempt to stand out and make our robot truly unique, we added a few special features. We crafted a simple spoiler from the foam board to enhance its appearance. Additionally, we equipped the robot with practical LED lighting, including headlights, backlights, and an underglow. These were carefully soldered to the board, serving both aesthetic and functional purposes by improving visibility and adding a touch of style.
